# koala-fy

koala-fy is a simple Chrome Extension that replaces *koalafiable*
text pieces with the :koala: emoji.

It is meant as a fun project and should be taken as such.
You can download it from the Chrome Web Store
[here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/koala-fy/jpdeekpjokblfbaolmgnkegmgfnfjime?).
